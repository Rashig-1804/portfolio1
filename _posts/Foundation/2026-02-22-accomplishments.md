## Introduction
CSSE 1 has taught me so many important skills of life and has improved my confidence in Computer science, which I didn't have, before this class. 

I have learned to work with an operating system and effectively use developer tools. I have also played important roles such as being both a Scrum Master and learner. Below, I will talk in depth, about each aspect of my growth

### Tools Journey 
Before, I was intimidated just looking at a computer system or platforms like Github, VSCode, Terminal, because I didn't know how to use them. However, throughout the trimester, I have gained so much confidence in these developer tools, due to our constant use of them. 

- I've learned how to effectively use Github to organize and manage components within a repository. 
- I've also learned how to work in VSCode, and create projects or blogs quick and efficient. 


### Scrum Master and Learner 
I have learned how to manage team projects and played a key role as a Scrum Master in class, while also learning new things from other peers

**I have...**
-   lead our team teach lesson of Data Abstractions
-   organized and outlined our Level 1 plan for the Murder Mystery Game
-   managed Kanban Boards in Github
-   encouraged collaboration
-   helped other teammates understand a strategy or new topic
-   learned from and gotten help from other teammates whether it was for a blog or VSCode issue


As a **team teacher**, an accomplishment of mine was:
Greatly contributing to creating an easy, interactive team teach lesson for **data abstractions** 

I helped by making the lesson vivid by using different colors for different texts. I also used common real world examples to make an abstract topic like data abstractions, more comprehendable.
