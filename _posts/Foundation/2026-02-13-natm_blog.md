## Night at The Museum!
I was able to attend Night at The Museum on February 12th, 2026! I collaborated with other peers from my CSSE Period 1 Class, and we presented our game, called Murder Mystery, a work in progress.

### My Experience
It was really interesting to be in a room of many innovative students who are also interested in computer science.
I was able to look at several different projects from CSP and CSA classes.

We were able to present the different levels of our game of Murder Mystery to many students and parents
