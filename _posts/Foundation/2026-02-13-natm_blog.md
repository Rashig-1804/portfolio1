## Night at The Museum!
I was able to attend Night at The Museum on February 12th, 2026! I collaborated with other peers from my CSSE Period 1 Class, and we presented our game, called Murder Mystery, a work in progress. 

Our team

</div>


### My Experience
It was really interesting to be in a room of many innovative students who are also interested in computer science.
I was able to look at several different projects from CSP and CSA classes.

We were able to present the different levels of our game of Murder Mystery to many students and parents

### Projects I saw at NATM
<div id="fun_facts"></div>

I was able to talk to many different CSP and CSA groups, and viewed their cool, interactive projects which involved frontend, backend, and features like API! Below are some of them that I found interesting.

<script>
var outputElement = document.getElementById("fun_facts");

// Clear the output
outputElement.innerHTML = '';

// Data array
const fun_facts_pic = [
  {flag: "{{site.baseurl}}/images/natm3.jpg", greeting: "Project 1", description: "This interactive poll asks someone which AI they find most helpful, and I learned that the coders used special API and database to keep count of the votes"},
  {flag: "{{site.baseurl}}/images/natm4.jpg", greeting: "Project 2", description: "This website is a trip planner and seems like a gamified way to plan a nice vacation! I learned that the coders also used API to list landmarks, shopping, and even weather"},
  {flag: "{{site.baseurl}}/images/natm5.jpg", greeting: "Project 3", description: "This platform is called Hunger Heroes and acts as a bridge between donors and receivers. I learned that the coders used backend database to manage user accounts and API for maps!"},
];

// Create a div container with id
const funFactsContainer = document.createElement('div');
funFactsContainer.id = 'fun_facts';

// Style the container 
funFactsContainer.style.border = '2px solid';
funFactsContainer.style.padding = '10px';

// Grid specific styles
funFactsContainer.style.display = 'grid';
funFactsContainer.style.gridTemplateColumns = 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))';
funFactsContainer.style.gap = '10px';

// Loop through data and create grid items
for (const location of fun_facts_pic) {
  // Create grid item
  const itemgrid = document.createElement('div');
  itemgrid.style.textAlign = 'center';
  
  // Create a flag image
  const imgs = document.createElement('img');
  imgs.src = location.flag;
  imgs.alt = location.description + ' Flag';
  imgs.style.width = '100%';
  imgs.style.height = '250px';
  imgs.style.objectFit = 'contain';
  
  // Create a description
  const description = document.createElement('p');
  description.textContent = location.description;
  description.style.margin = '5px 0';
  description.style.fontWeight = 'bold';
  
  // Create a greeting
  const greeting = document.createElement('p');
  greeting.textContent = location.greeting;
  greeting.style.margin = '5px 0';
  greeting.style.fontStyle = 'italic';
  greeting.style.opacity = '0.7';
  
  // Add all elements to grid item
  itemgrid.appendChild(imgs);
  itemgrid.appendChild(description);
  itemgrid.appendChild(greeting);
  
  // Add grid item to container
  funFactsContainer.appendChild(itemgrid);
}

// Add containter to output 
outputElement.appendChild(funFactsContainer);
